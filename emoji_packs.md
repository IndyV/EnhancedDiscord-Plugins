# Emoji Packs
Allows you to replace Discord's emojis with a new set.

__**NOTE: All of these packs are incomplete.**__ This is because they all rely on 3rd-party hosting of the assets. If you know a source where all the assets for a particular emoji pack are located, let us know in the support server.

#### To change the set of emojis you're using:
1. Click the "User Settings" gear in the bottom left.
2. Under the EnhancedDiscord group, go to the "Settings" tab.
3. You should see a section labeled "Emoji Packs". Simply click on the pack you would like to use.
4. To see the emojis change on all cached messages, you will need to reload your client (Ctrl+R).
5. Enjoy your new emojis!
