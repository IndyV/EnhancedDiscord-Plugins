# EnhancedDiscord-Plugins
Extra plugins for [EnhancedDiscord](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord/tree/beta).

** As of now, these will only work with the [BETA](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord/tree/beta) verstion. Stable version will reject them for not having an ID, and may cause errors for not having `findRawModule`.
