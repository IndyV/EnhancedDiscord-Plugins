# Dev Helpers
Makes the Discord dev tools a little less annoying to use.

- Prevents you from being logged out if your client dies while having dev tools open. This happens due to Discord's funtion to remove the `token` entry from `localStorage` while the dev tools are open, and add them back when dev tools are closed or the client is "safely" closed.
- Replaces the "Hold Up!" message with a parody of it, cause why not ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
